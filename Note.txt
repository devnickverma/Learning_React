Step 1: Create a new React app
=> Command: npm create vite@latest
- This command initializes a new Vite project with React. 
- Vite is a modern build tool that offers fast development and optimized builds.

Step 2: Install dependencies
=> Command: npm install
- This command installs all the required node_modules for your React application. 
- These modules include React and other dependencies needed for your app to run.

Lecture 5:
Assignment: 
- Implement functionality to ensure the counter value remains between a maximum of 20 and a minimum of 0.
- This means you should modify the `addValue` and `removeValue` functions to include these constraints.

Virtual DOM:
- Lightweight representation of the actual DOM in memory.
- Helps React efficiently update the browser’s DOM by comparing changes.
- Only necessary updates are made to the real DOM for better performance.

Fiber: 
- React’s internal engine for handling the reconciliation algorithm.
- Breaks rendering into smaller, prioritized tasks for smoother performance.
- Allows asynchronous rendering, making apps more responsive.

Reconciliation:
- Process of determining what changes are needed in the DOM.
- Compares current and previous Virtual DOM versions to find updates.
- Minimizes direct DOM manipulation for faster, optimized updates.
