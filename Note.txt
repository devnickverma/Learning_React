Step 1: Create a new React app
=> Command: npm create vite@latest
- This command initializes a new Vite project with React. 
- Vite is a modern build tool that offers fast development and optimized builds.

Step 2: Install dependencies
=> Command: npm install 
- This command installs all the required node_modules for your React application. 
- These modules include React and other dependencies needed for your app to run.

Lecture 5:
Assignment: 
- Implement functionality to ensure the counter value remains between a maximum of 20 and a minimum of 0.
- This means you should modify the `addValue` and `removeValue` functions to include these constraints.

Virtual DOM:
- Lightweight representation of the actual DOM in memory.
- Helps React efficiently update the browser’s DOM by comparing changes.
- Only necessary updates are made to the real DOM for better performance.

Fiber: 
- React’s internal engine for handling the reconciliation algorithm.
- Breaks rendering into smaller, prioritized tasks for smoother performance.
- Allows asynchronous rendering, making apps more responsive.

Reconciliation:
- Process of determining what changes are needed in the DOM.
- Compares current and previous Virtual DOM versions to find updates.
- Minimizes direct DOM manipulation for faster, optimized updates.

Install Tailwind CSS:

1. Visit the Tailwind CSS installation guide: 
   - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

2. Install Tailwind CSS as a development dependency:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     npm install -D tailwindcss

3. Initialize Tailwind CSS to create a configuration file:
   - Execute the following command:
     npx tailwindcss init

Props:

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another in React, allowing components to be dynamic and reusable.

Example Props for the Card Component:
- username: (string) The name of the user displayed on the card.
- btnText: (string, optional) The text to be displayed on the button. Default value is "Follow".

Usage:
<Card username="DevNeon" btnText="Follow 1" />
This will render a card with the username "DevNeon" and a button labeled "Follow 1".
